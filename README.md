# Letting 3D Guide the Way: 3D Guided 2D Few-Shot Image Classification (WACV 2024)
This is official pytorch implementation of WACV 2024 paper 3DG2D paper. Please check our paper [here](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2024/papers/Chen_Letting_3D_Guide_the_Way_3D_Guided_2D_Few-Shot_Image_WACV_2024_paper.pdf). The pipeline of our proposed method is shown below: ![avatar](Img\flow.PNG)

## Quick Learning
For your convenience, you could go to **./Model/Img_few_shot_prj.py** directly for quick learning of our method. I prepared a toy example in the main function there. By setting fs=='AINet' in the class *ThreeD_Support_Net*, you use AINet as few-shot head for the prediction. 

Besides, you could also got to **./Model/Head/AINet.py** to check our proposed AINet. I prepare a toy exmpale in the main function there for you quick learning.

## Data Preparation
All the query images are from [1], and support images are generated by us from 3D mesh data. We introduce how we obtain the data below:

### ModelNet40
For query images, please go to [here](https://github.com/rehg-lab/lowshot-shapebias) to download ModelNet40-LS, and save save the query image into ***path to query***

For support projections generated by us, you could download directly from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U6VLcY-kEhQhkWI3fkA-ObJOlC88Ytfa/view?usp=share_link). Unzip it and save the data to ***path to support***
